### High level course explanation

Software is a key part of the organization's "perimeter" but to many security people the engineering / development team can feel like a "black box". At the same time, product security is a complex, constantly changing and high-risk area for which the traditional security team is still considered responsible.

In this one-of-a-kind course, you will learn:

* How to bridge the gap with engineering by getting leadership buy-in
* How to build security processes which meet developers where they are
* How to use scanning tools to accelerate your efforts without causing developer fatigue

To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams (or individually if you prefer) on table-top exercises which simulate real challenges and situations which you might come across when building a software security programme.

These exercises are based on our highly successful model from previous courses and give you the opportunity to plan your approach (using our in-house developed templates and tools) and then explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders.

Be ready to leave the course with clear strategies and ideas on how to build a valuable product security programme with strong engineering support.
